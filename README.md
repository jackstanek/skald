# Skald

Skald is a little Scheme interpreter I'm writing to teach myself about
interpreter design, and to learn about how Rust works. Not much here
at the moment, but hopefully this should be working sometime this
summer (2019)! The goal is to implement (at least most of) the
[R5RS](https://schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/r5rs.pdf)
standard.

To build, clone this directory and run `cargo build`.

## Roadmap
  * [ ] Integer literals
  * [ ] String literals
  * [ ] Lists / Sexps, primitive expressions
  * [ ] Macros
  * [ ] Vectors
  * [ ] Procedure calls, lambdas, closures
  * [ ] Maybe more...
